Dark vessel scanning for sustainable seas.

One-third of fish stocks are operated beyond sustainable levels and an estimated 30–50% of critical marine habitats have been lost due to human industrialization. (Paolo, 2024)

Today, a third of sharks, rays, and chimaeras are at risk of extinction owing to overfishing (Bradley, n.d.), a disaster only made worse by the 72–76% of the world’s non publicly tracked-illegal-industrial fishing vessels.
